# HW10DHSGroup2

Main function: #Xiaoya
Goal: reads in ShortenClientMerged.txt, then construct a "time-series" graph where the x axis is ratio of people who received mental health in one famile (each CaseID) (for now assume the case # is assigned chronologically) and the y axis is the number of open and closing times of each case. Will do so by calling AggregateByCase and send its output to PlotByTime for a scatter plot.
